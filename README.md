# Formik Form Project
# Description
An assignment with MIT xPro to build a Formik login form with validation.

# How To Run
After loading in a browser window, fill in the email and password fields, at submit there will be a Login Successful alert along with a console log of those values.

# Roadmap of Future Improvement
I would like to further learn the functionalities of Formik, and add more to the form.
